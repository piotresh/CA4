    <p>Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I'm thrilled to have you here. Allow me to introduce myself and share some of the exciting projects I've been working on.

About Me

I'm a passionate programmer with a diverse background and a love for creating innovative solutions. Originally from Krakow, Poland, and raised in the picturesque landscapes of Scotland, I've always had a thirst for knowledge and a curiosity for the world around me. My journey into the world of programming began with humble beginnings, and it's been an exhilarating ride ever since.

Projects

One of the highlights of my journey has been the opportunity to work on various projects that showcase my skills and creativity. Here are a couple of projects that I'm particularly proud of:

Tic Tac Toe App:
Who doesn't love a classic game of Tic Tac Toe? I've developed a sleek and intuitive Tic Tac Toe application that brings this timeless game to life in a digital format. Whether you're playing solo against the computer or challenging a friend to a match, this app promises endless hours of fun and entertainment.

Student Budget App:
As a former student myself, I understand the importance of managing finances effectively. That's why I created a student budget app designed to help students track their expenses, set financial goals, and stay on top of their budget. With user-friendly features and customizable settings, this app empowers students to take control of their finances and achieve their financial objectives.
